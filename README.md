# Hide-Seek
Game1
At this foulder i try to make a HIDE&SEEK game. We have a family which contains father, mother, daughter (3.5 years old)
and an infant (baby, 8 months). The family lives at a home with 5 rooms and in each room, there are 5 boxes. After the father comes back from the work, all the family members do not have any energy whatsoever, except the baby who sucks the energies out of mom and dad by cuddling them!
After the dinner, the father has 100 energy points, the daughter has 100 energy points, the mother has still no energy, but she can walk from room to room.

Now, the daughter loves to pay hide and seek with her father. At 18:00 they start playing hide and seek with following rules:
    • The family come to room 1 and father starts counting down
    • The daughter can go any room and hide in one of the boxes in any room
    • The mother takes baby and she goes to a random room
    • The father searches every box from room 1 and if he cannot find the daughter he goes to other consecutive rooms and continues searching the daughter
    • Searching a box takes 1 (one) energy point from the father and lasts a minute, except following case:
    • If the mother goes any room number with smaller than or equal to that of daughter’s room number (say, mother goes to room 2, the daughter goes either room 2,3, etc), the mother hands the baby to the father during his search. This time after the dad starts holding the baby, he loses 2 energy points for every box search after he has taken the baby.
    • Then, when the father finds the daughter he come backs to room 1 and leaves the baby there and immediately mom picks the baby and she goes another random room in the second round of game.
    • If the daughter sees that father holds the baby for 3 times, the daughter starts crying and game over
    • If the father has less than 0 (zero) energy, this also causes of game over
